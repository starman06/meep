hi i just learned js this the first thing i made with js (⌐■_■)
if you want this as an app on windows do this:
install node.js from nodejs.org
and install npm (usualy comes with node js)
install electron
install nativefier by opening cmd an typing: npm install -g nativfier then press enter
then open an empty folder click the adress bar then type cmd and press enter
now type: nativefier "starman06.github.io/meep/leep.html"
when its done close cmd then open meep-win32-x64 and open meep.exe (if you don't see that then open meep)
there you go!!!!!!!!
